**Welcome to my Dividend Calculator App!**

This app is a tool to help you evaluate your potential dividend
allocation. Simply navigate to _investopedia.com_ to get the required
info on the stocks you want to preview.

You can then create a portfolio strategy by adding stocks and
playing around with the values and see the effects of the changes
in realtime
